# Plans
This is a folder, to help us manage and communicate effectively as a team.

## Getting Started
The plan folder, will consist of subfolders of dates. This will allow us to track how we are progressing daily and allow us to instantly see if our proposed targets were actually met. 

### Gannt Chart 
Finally, there will be a Gannt Chart located in a sub folder. This will allow us to track how much time was spent on each section and how in the future we could allocate tasks better.
